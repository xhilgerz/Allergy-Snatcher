      <h1>What is Allergy Snatcher?</h1>
      <p>
        Allergy Snatcher is a modern platform designed to make food discovery safer, 
        easier, and more accessible for everyone. Whether you're gluten-free, 
        dairy-free, vegan, managing allergies, or following a lifestyle diet like keto, 
        our tools help you quickly identify foods that align with your needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users can add foods, apply dietary restriction tags, view ingredients, and 
        explore a growing community-curated database. Our mission is to remove the 
        stress of navigating dietary limitations, empowering you to make confident and 
        informed food choices every day.
      </p>

      <h1>Who Created It?</h1>
      <p>
        Allergy Snatcher was developed by a dedicated team of student engineers 
        passionate about improving everyday health and accessibility:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seth Chicks</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Alekzander Brysch</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Carlos Meija Rosales</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Together, we set out to build a platform that not only supports individuals with 
        allergies and dietary restrictions, but also fosters a community centered on 
        safer eating and informed food exploration.
